    <h1>Old good wine</h1>
    <p>I'ts funny, because I didn't take wine tasty, I didn't like it. But then from watching a show, a character was drinking it in every shoot
        and I was like, I want to try it, and I did, and I liked it. I don't know if it was because of the show or because I was ready to try it.
        But I liked it, and now I drink it from time to time, <strong>or when I crave it</strong>.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 bottle of wine</li>
        <li>1 glass</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the bottle</li>
        <li>Pour the wine in the glass</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Yes I know, just buying a bottle and thats it? And yes, it would awesome if we made it but taking the time for them to make it. It's gonna be 
        somewhat long, and I don't have the time for that. So I just buy it, and enjoy it. Easy and tasty.
