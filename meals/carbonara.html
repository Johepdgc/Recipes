    <h1>Pasta for lovely nigths</h1>

    <p>This recipe is simple, easy and fast. But more important tasty, and you wish more after finished.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Long pasta of preference, <em>but it's recommended to use linguini</em></li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of milk, <em>(whole milk if posible)</em></li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>1/8 cup of parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/8 cup of olive oil</li>
        <li>3 to 4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper up to taste</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To start we have to put water in a pot and let it with high fire until it strt to boil. In the mean time, we can chop the bacon as we like, 
            <em>personally i like to do it in cubes so it spreads more easyly in the pasta.</em> And measure the quantity of pasta that we want to cook.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the water is boiling, we put the pasta in the pot and let it cook for 10 to 12 minutes, <em>or until it's al dente</em>. 
            <em>Remember to stir the pasta from time to time to avoid it to stick to the pot.</em> As soon as the pasta is full covered by the water i like to put a teaspoon of olive oil and some salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the pasta is cooking we can start cooking the bacon. <em>Why the bacon first?</em>, because we need the oil that the bacon will release (and because it takes longer), then we put our garlic cloves, when the garlic
            is starting to look golden brown, we add our cheese and milk. <strong>We have be aware of our sauce, if you want it thick, let it cook more time, if you want it more liquid, less time.</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the pasta is ready, we strain it and put it in the sauce pan, and mix it with the sauce. <em>As said earlier, if you want the pasta with souce thick, let it cook more time if not less, but as recommendation is better
            when is more thicker.</em>
        </li>
        <li>And to finish, when your serve you can put a little but of parmesan cheese on top with bacon sprinkles. And thats it!</li>
    </ol>
